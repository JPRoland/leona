- Interfaces?
- Field resolvers in objects and mutations? (Spec has no meta) - separate def
- Default values in queries
- Mutations!
- Custom scalars

Issues
* Interfaces and Unions
 - More nuanced paers of the GraphQL toolset but allow us to write better queries.
* Descriptions on Objects
 - Fields are easy but with objects we lose the spec name.
* Input Objects
 - Currently input specs are expanded and each arg is included. Input Objects were included to reduce repetition.
* Custom Scalars
 - Date parse/serialize
